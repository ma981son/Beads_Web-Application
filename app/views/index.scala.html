  <h1>About Beads</h1>

  <p>
    Beadwork is the art or craft of attaching beads to one another by stringing them onto a thread or thin wire with a
    sewing or beading needle or sewing them to cloth. Beads are produced in a diverse range of materials, shapes, and
    sizes, and vary by the kind of art produced. Most often, beadwork is a form of personal adornment (e.g. jewelry),
    but it also commonly makes up other artworks.
